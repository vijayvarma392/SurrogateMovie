# SurrogateMovie
Pretty movie describing the surrogate modeling method.

This video shows a 1-d example of a non-spinning surrogate, the data for which
was generated using the SEOBNRv4 waveform model. We show greedy basis for the
real part of the l=m=2 mode, but then switch to amplitude and build a surrogate
for that. A high-level explanation of the procedure can be found
[here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~vvarma/surrogates.html). For a technical
description of the surrogate modeling method, see
[arxiv:1701.00550](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00550) or 
[arxiv:1308.3565](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3565).

## Video files
waves.mp4: Greedy basis construction.

ei.mp4: Empirical interpolation.

fits.mp4: Fits across parameter space.

eval.mp4: Evalution of surrogate.

full_movie.mp4: The whole shebang.

full_movie.gif: gif version of full_movie.mp4. Lower quality and higher file
size, so use the mp4 version unless you need a gif.

Each of the above file names, except full_movie.mp4 also has a companion .png file that has the first frame of the video.
Also, waveamp.png shows the last frame of waves.mp4.

If you use these videos, don't forget to credit me ([Vijay
Varma](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~vvarma/))!
