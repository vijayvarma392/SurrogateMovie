        In order for LIGO to detect gravitational waves and do astrophysics, it
        is crucial to have an accurate model of the gravitational waves.
        Numerical relativity (NR) is the only method that accurately models the
        merger part of a binary black hole signal. However, these
        simulations are prohibitively expensive for most direct applications.
                                </p>

                                <p>
        Therefore, several approximate waveform models have been developed over
        the years. The two main approaches have been dubbed "Phenomenological"
        and "Effective-one-body" waveforms. These models typically make some
        assumptions about the phenomenology of the waveforms, based on good
        physical motivations. Then, any remaining free parameters are set by
        fitting against NR simulations. These models are also quite fast and
        can be directly used for GW applications.
                                </p>

                                <p>
        Surrogate modeling is a data driven approach to waveform modeling that
        has come about in the last few years. Here, we do not make any
        assumptions about the underlying phenomenology but rather use the NR
        waveforms themselves to implicitly reconstruct the phenomenology. This
        is achieved by first building an accurate basis using the NR waveforms
        themselves and then using some fancy interpolation methods to construct
        a waveform model.
            </p>    
                                <p> This website shows a video demonstration
        of the surrogate modelling procedure. We construct a surrogate model
        for nonspinning binary black holes. The total mass scales out of the
        system and the only free parameter is the mass ratio (q). We use the
        SEOBNRv4 waveform model for this demonstration, but the same can be
        done with NR waveforms. These movies can be found

                                <h3>Reduced basis</h3>

                                <p> To build a surrogate model, we begin with
        a dataset of waveforms. In this case, this is nonspinning waveforms
        with q between 1 and 10.  The first step is to construct an accurate
        basis that represents our space of waveforms. We do this using the very
        waveforms we are trying to model. The basis functions are picked in an
        iterative manner where in each step the waveform that has the highest
        projection error onto the current basis, gets added to the basis for
        the next iteration. We proceed until the projection error goes below a
        chosen threshold. In this manner we pick out the most representative
        waveforms to form our basis, and reduce the dataset in the q direction
        to a small set of basis functions.
                                </p>

                                <p> In the movie below, we show what the
        selected waveforms might look like. We first show the real part of the
        (2,2) mode, which is highly oscillatory. It is much easier to build a
        model for a slowly varying function, therefore we instead work with the
        amplitude and phase of the (2,2) mode. At the end of the movie we show
        the amplitudes of the selected waveforms, which are much simpler.  In
        this example, we will construct a surrogate model for the amplitude.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Empirical interpolation</h3>

                                <p> Having constructed our basis, the next
        step is to reduce the data in the time direction. This is done using
        the empirical interpolation method, which iteratively picks out the
        time values that are most representative. Only these time values,
        called the empirical time nodes, are used in constructing an
        empirical interpolant in time. This is shown in the movie below.
                                </p>

            <p></br></p>
                                <h3>Parametric fits</h3>

                                <p> At this point we have condensed our dataset
            in both q and time directions. Given our basis functions, all we
            need to evaluate the waveform is the basis coefficients so that
            we can project the basis functions. Thanks to the empirical
            interpolant method, these coefficients only need to be evaluated
            at the empirical time nodes. However, what if we want to evaluate
            the waveform at a random point in the parameter space where we
            don't have a basis function?
                                </p>

                                <p> To do this, we first construct fits
            across parameter space, at each of the empirical time nodes, as
            demonstrated below.
                                </p>

            <p></br></p>
                                <h3>Evaluation</h3>

                                <p> Finally, to evaluate the waveform at
            a random parameter space point: We first evaluate the fits at that
            point. This gives usthe basis coefficients, which we use to
            project the basis functions to get the amplitude evaluation.
