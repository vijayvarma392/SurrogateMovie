# SurrogateMovie
Pretty movie describing the surrogate modeling method.

For a technical desciption of the surrogate modeling method, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00550 or https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3565.

This video shows a 1-d example of a non-spinning surrogate, the data for which was generated using the SEOBNRv4 waveform model. We show greedy basis for the real part of the l=m=2 mode, but then switch to amplitude and build a surrogate for that.

## Video files
waves.mp4: Greedy basis construction.  
ei.mp4: Empirical interpolation.  
fits.mp4: Fits across parameter space.  
eval.mp4: Evalution of surrogate.  
full_movie.mp4: The whole shebang.  

Each of the above file names, except full_movie.mp4 also has a companion .png file that has the first frame of the video.
Also, waveamp.png shows the last frame of waves.mp4.

If you use these videos, don't forget to credit me (Vijay Varma)!
